                Hi, my name is Michael Guillen and i'm currently a student finishing my final
                semester at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm finishing my government degree
                in the Liberal Arts College, with a Business Foundations Certificate and a Spanish
                minor. I was one of the founding fathers of the Delta Upsilon fraternity on campus, 
                with our focus being based around diversity, justice, and service. I also was involved
                in several other organizations such as Students for Bernie Sanders, Campus Events and 
                Entertainment, and University Democrats. Last summer, I interned for The Austin School
                for the Visual and Performing Arts as the Non-profit Manager. Finally, i'm finishing up 
                my post-graduate education with a certificate from the University of Texas at Austin
                Web Development Bootcamp.

                On the personal side of things, I'm originally from Temple, TX, a small town just an hour 
                north of Austin. I am passionate about several things, all things I hope to make some sort
                of impact in eventually with my abilities and education. I love basketball, both playing and 
                watching. Music, especially hip-hop/rap, is the thing that gives me energy throughout the day.
                I've always had a passion for theatre arts and film, and hope to bring that to underprivilaged 
                kids eventually in my life. Finally, fashion has always been an important aspect to me as well, 
                and I believe it's an important way to express oneself. I would eventually like to design my own
                clothing and find a way for underprivlaged kids to have more access to affordable clothes
                that they would like to wear.
